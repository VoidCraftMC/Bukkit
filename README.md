# Bukkit
My personal bukkit plugins and projects.
Feel free to copy and paste/steal anything here.
<br>
The code here is just a tiny example of my projects. Most of the work I do is for someone's private project, or my own Minecraft server (vcmc.me) and my Website.

Note: 
I don't like to put the whole jar filesystem here because this github is for public code examples. It just makes it easier to access.
